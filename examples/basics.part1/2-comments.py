"""
Python allows you to write comments inside of your code.
Comments are used to explain the code and to make it easier to read for yourself and others.
Comments are not executed by the computer so you can write them anywhere in your code.

Let's write some comments!
There are two types of comments in Python:
1. Single Line Comments
2. Multi-Line Comments

Single line comments start with a # and go to the end of the line.
Here is an example:
"""

print("Hello World!")  # This is a comment and will not be executed

"""
Multi-line comments start with a triple quote and go to the end of the line.
This comment right here that you're reading is an example of a multi-line comment.

Try creating a few comments in your code and see what happens!
